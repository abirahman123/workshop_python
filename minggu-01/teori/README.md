###Whetting Your Appetite###
Python is a programming language that is ideal for automating tasks on computers, such as search-and-replace over text files or renaming photo files. It is simpler to use than C/C++/Java and offers much more structure and support than shell scripts or batch files. Python is a real programming language with built-in high-level data types and is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or Perl. Python is also an interpreted language, making it easy to experiment with features of the language and to test functions during program development. Programs written in Python are typically shorter and more readable than equivalent programs in C/C++/Java. Python is extensible, making it easy to add new built-in functions or modules to the interpreter. Finally, Python is named after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and has nothing to do with reptiles.

###Using the Python Interpreter###
The Python interpreter can be invoked by typing "python3.11" to the shell. On Windows machines, the "python3.11" command will be available if you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store. Alternatively, if you have the "py.exe" launcher installed, you can use the "py" command. To exit the interpreter, type "quit()" or use the end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt.

The interpreter provides line-editing features such as interactive editing, history substitution, and code completion on systems that support the GNU Readline library. To check whether command line editing is supported, type Control-P to the first Python prompt. If it beeps, you have command line editing; otherwise, you'll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.

The interpreter can read and execute commands interactively when called with standard input connected to a tty device, or it can read and execute a script from a file when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input. Some Python modules can also be invoked as scripts using the "python -m module" command.

When a script file is used, you can run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards by passing "-i" before the script. The script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the "argv" variable in the "sys" module. When no script and no arguments are given, "sys.argv[0]" is an empty string.

###An Informal Introduction to Python###
This section explains the conventions used in Python examples, including distinguishing input and output with prompts, the use of comments, and how to toggle the display of prompts and output. Input is shown after the prompt (>>>), and output is shown without a prompt. Comments start with the hash symbol (#) and extend to the end of the line, and they are used to clarify the code but are not interpreted by Python. Comments can appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. The examples can be copied and pasted into the interpreter by hiding the prompts and output.
